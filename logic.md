This app performs 3 steps:
### Step 1
Get a random category, e.g.get a random category, e.g. "https://www.britannica.com/sitemap/c". This step is simple, as we just need to choose a random letter a-z.

### Step 2
Query how many links there are in that category and choose one of them, e.g. "https://www.britannica.com/sitemap/c/190".

### Step 3
On that page get the article link and redirect there, e.g. "https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Coming-of-Post-Industrial-Society-A-Venture-in-Social-Forecasting" (that's the first link in my example)
